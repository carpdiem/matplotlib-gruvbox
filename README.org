#+title: A gruvbox style for Matplotlib

A simple, dark-background color style for the [[http://www.matplotlib.org][Matplotlib]] plotting
library for Python, based on Pavel Pertsevs [[https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox][Gruvbox]] color palette and
theme, that I have mainly made to fit in to my Emacs/org-mode theme.

I may include the light-background Gruvbox variant later, but I mainly
made this to have a good dark-background style.

I made this based on this [[https://www.hfstevance.com/blog/2019/7/22/matplotlib-style][blog post]] Héloïse Stevance ([[https://twitter.com/sydonahi][@sydonahi]] on
Twitter), and adding a bit of extra spice.

* Screenshot
This is what a simple multi line plot looks like. The data used are
filter throughput curves for the UVIS and IR channels at the Hubble
Space Telescope.

* Installation
To try it out, place the file ~gruvbox.mplstyle~ in the folder you are
working in, and insert the lines:

#+begin_src python :results silent
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.style.use('gruvbox.mplstyle')
#+end_src

to your script or notebook.

To make it available from anywhere, follow the instructions in the
blog post linked above.

* Misc.
- The theme sets a background color for the figure canvas and one for
  the Axes. If you want the figure canvas to be transparent, set:
  
 #+begin_src python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   plt.rcParams['figure.facecolor'] = 'none'
 #+end_src
 
  somewhere in your working code, or comment out the corresponding
  line in the ~.mplstyle~ file to het rid of it for good.
